For more comprehensive lists of people who are far more important and influential than me, check out [uses.tech](https://uses.tech).

But, if you're curious, this is a list of tools (and stuff) that make me happy and keep me productive.
This serves as a living document and is bound to change from time to time.
I'll try keep it as up to date as I can.

## Editor + IDE's

- I use Emacs for most things, with Evil (vim) keybindings everywhere. I currently use the [Doom](https://github.com/hlissner/doom-emacs) distribution of Emacs, but I'm slowly writing my own config using literal programming (in org) which you can see [here](https://github.com/rameezk/dotfiles/blob/master/emacs/.emacs.d/emacs-config.org).
- For Python development, I use PyCharm.
- I use the [Jetbrains Mono](https://www.jetbrains.com/lp/mono/) font, but I sometime switch between [Fira Code](https://github.com/tonsky/FiraCode) and [Hack](https://github.com/source-foundry/Hack).

## Terminal

- I use GNOME terminal on Ubuntu and iTerm2 on MacOS.
- I use [Jetbrains Mono Nerd Font](https://github.com/ryanoasis/nerd-fonts/blob/master/patched-fonts/JetBrainsMono/Regular/complete/JetBrains%20Mono%20Regular%20Nerd%20Font%20Complete%20Mono%20Windows%20Compatible.ttf) to get some nice glyphs.
- I use ZSH with [Antibody](https://github.com/getantibody/antibody) as a plugin manager. I probably have too many aliases.
- All my tooling configs live in my [dotfiles](https://github.com/rameezk/dotfiles).

## Digital Garden + Building a Second Brain

- I use [org-journal](https://github.com/bastibe/org-journal) for capturing my day quickly.
- These notes sometimes expand to more in-depth notes which I keep track of using [org-roam](https://www.orgroam.com). These notes are easily searchable and have saved my hide a good few times. "I feel like I've solved this problem before" - Rameez. Just search it!
- My Digital Garden is private for now, but I have ideas to open source it.

## Productiviy

- I try to minimise distractions by keeping a clutter free workspace.
- I'm a huge fan of the [Pomodoro Technique](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pomodoro_Technique).
- I block all my intensive tasks together for mornings and try keep meetings and other admin for the afternoons.
- Use [Todoist](https://todoist.com/) for keeping track of all my tasks.

## Money

- I use [22Seven](https://www.22seven.com) for creating budgets and keeping track of where my money goes.
- I also update [FinancialHealth.app](https://financialhealth.app) (shameless plug!) once a month to track my journey to [FIRE](https://www.daveramsey.com/blog/what-is-the-fire-movement).
- My investment philosophy is simple, "Buy the whole world, as cheaply as possible". I invest in STXWDM on the JSE (in my tax free savings account in South Africa) and in VT offshore.
- I purchase a bit of BTC every month as well (just to keep the BTC people happy :P).
- I try to automate all investments and savings as much as possible to keep my emotional brain (and sometimes, heart) out of it.

# Workspace

- I use a standing desk and try to alternate between sitting and standing. I try and reserve standing for more intensive tasks so I can flex my power stance.
- I alternate between a pair of Bose QC35 II's and Airpods (the non noise cancelling one).
- I use a single (more than one is far too distracting) [4K monitor](https://www.dell.com/za/enterprise/p/dell-u2720q-monitor/pd) with a single USB-C thunderbolt 3 cable to minimize cable clutter.
- I use a [Logitech M705 Marathon Mouse](https://www.logitech.com/en-za/product/marathon-mouse-m705) because I hate buying batteries.
- I use a (CM Storm Quick Fire Rapid I)[https://www.coolermaster.com/catalog/peripheral/keyboards/quick-fire-rapid-i/] mechanical keyboard with blue keys to annoy my wife. The true beauty of a mechanical keyboard is that even if you not doing much, it sounds like you're doing a lot!
