We are truly living in the future folks!

Or, I may have been living under a rock. 

Seriously, I never thought this would be possible on iOS/iPhone. But with some initial setup it is!

So without further ado, this is how I managed to write and deploy this post using only my iPhone. 

# Apps Used
- [Working Copy][1] - Git client
- [Textastic][2]- Text editor with syntax highlighting 
- [Canva][3]- Image editing and templating

# Workflow

In Working Copy I linked GitHub account and cloned my  blog repo. My blog is written in Gatsby and uses thing to convert Markdown to what you see now. So in Working Copy I navigated to my `posts` directory and created a new directory. Within that directory I created an empty `index.md`file. 

Next I opened up Canva and created an empty template of 1500px150px (by post banner) and created a quick banner. If you've never used Canva before, they have some very cool stock photos and templates.

That's it for now.
