We are truly living in the future folks!

Or, I may have been living under a rock. 

Seriously, I never thought this would be possible on iOS/iPhone. But with some initial setup it is!

So without further ado, this is how I managed to write and deploy this post using only my iPhone. 

# Apps Used
- [Working Copy][1] - Git client
- [Textastic][2]- Text editor with syntax highlighting 
- [Canva][3]- Image editing and templating

# Heading 
## heading 2

That's it for now.

Peace ‚úåüèΩ
